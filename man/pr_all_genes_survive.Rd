\title{Probability of passing down all autosomal genes to offspring}
\usage{
pr_all_genes_survive(
  number_of_children,
  chromosome_length = 267.66,
  log10 = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{number_of_children}{How many offspring? Result is vectorised over this
parameter.}

\item{chromosome_length}{Default is 267.77 cM (an estimate of the length of
chromosome 1). \code{length(chromosome_length)>1}, the
probability of passing down all chromosomes will be
computed.}

\item{log10}{Should the log10 probability be returned? Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\description{
Donnelly (1983) presents a way to efficiently calculate the probability of
passing down all genes to the next generation. This includes both the
paternally and maternally inherited genes, so at least two offspring are
needed for this probability to be non-zero.

\examples{
## Example from Donnelly (1983)
# (historic) chromosome lengths (cM) used in Donnelly (1983)
L <- 33 * c(9.12, 8.53, 7.16, 6.59, 6.15, 5.87, 5.31, 4.92, 4.81, 4.71, 4.60,
            4.47, 3.56, 3.60, 3.40, 3.20, 3.12, 2.72, 2.48, 2.27, 1.77, 1.64)

# Reproduce the "Offspring" column in Table 1
number_of_children <- 1:16
pr_survival <- pr_all_genes_survive(number_of_children, chromosome_length = L)

# Plot the results (compare to Fig. 10)
plot(number_of_children, pr_survival)

# Add the Poisson approximation
k <- 2:17 - 1
lines(k+1, exp(-k*33 / (2^k)), lty=2)

## Example using general purpose methods
# The probability of passing down all genes to k offspring is equal to the
# probability that the joint IBD state of k half siblings is 0 everywhere -
# there is no point where they all inherited the same DNA from the common
# parent.

# Define a function to create a pedigree of half siblings
ped_halfsibs <- function(number_of_half_sibs){
  ped <- pedtools::nuclearPed(nch = 1)
  for (k in 2:number_of_half_sibs) {
    ped <- pedtools::addChild(ped, parents = c(1), verbose = FALSE)
  }
  ped
}

# Compute the probability that a chromosome of length 100 cm survives
# if the next generation consists of 5 children
p1 <- pr_all_genes_survive(number_of_children = 5L, chromosome_length = 100)
p2 <- d_cibd(x = 100, ibd = 0, pedigree = ped_halfsibs(5))

p1
p2
stopifnot(all.equal(p1, p2))

# If you have five children, which fraction of chromosome 1
# is passed down to the next generation? Assume a length of 268 cM

# Pr. of passing down the complete grand-maternal and grand-paternal parts
# is 42\%
pr_all_genes_survive(number_of_children = 5L, chromosome_length = 268)

# The distribution of the fraction that is passed down has a point
# mass of 0.42 at 100\% and has a continuous density with weight 0.58
dist <- total_ibd_dist(ped_halfsibs(5), ibd_state = 0,
chromosome_length = 267, fraction = TRUE)
